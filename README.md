# SQL-Generator
Background:

The University of Southern California's research team embarked on a project aimed at enhancing the management, scalability, and efficiency of relational databases. The primary challenge faced was the labor-intensive processes of generating SQL commands, managing large datasets, and ensuring the overall integrity of data within Snowflake.

Objective:

Simplify and optimize data management procedures in Snowflake.
Boost scalability by overcoming row limitations in Snowflake.
Reduce the execution time of SQL statements.
Ensure primary key integrity and unique data validation.
Achieve 100% code accuracy especially concerning special character recognition and datatype mapping.

Methodology & Tools:

Automated SQL Generation: Developed a Python-based program using libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Snowflake.connector.
Database Table Function: Focused on preserving primary key integrity, ensuring unique validation, and dynamically generating SQL commands.
Batch Processing: Designed a versatile function to navigate Snowflake's 16,000-row runtime limitation, boosting the system's scalability.
ETL Framework Rectification: Collaborated with peers to resolve coding issues. This included addressing challenges related to special character recognition and datatype mapping in Snowflake.

Results:

Achieved a 75% simplification in data management processes by optimizing the code.
Reduced the SQL statement execution time drastically from 120 minutes to just 5 seconds.
Enhanced system scalability by 80%, successfully bypassing the inherent row limitations of Snowflake.
Accomplished 100% code accuracy, ensuring data integrity and smooth ETL processes.

Conclusion:

The project's success lay in the fusion of a collaborative approach, expertise in Python programming, and a deep understanding of Snowflake's capabilities and limitations. By optimizing procedures and innovatively bypassing system limitations, we have set a benchmark in efficient database management for academic research.
